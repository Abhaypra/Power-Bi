## Introduction

In this repository, I have undertaken various projects where I leverage the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful insights. The data is sourced from various platforms such as Kaggle and web scraping. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I use Power BI to generate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), visualizations, and comprehensive dashboards.

## Projects

Each project folder in this repository contains:

- The source of the data
- The raw data files in CSV and Excel formats
- The cleaned data (if applicable)
- The Power BI report file (.pbix)


You can understand the workflow and analysis by reviewing the provided CSV and Excel files in each project folder.

## Data Sources

The data for these projects is collected from various sources including:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Web scraping from multiple websites

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. For each project, I ensure that the data is cleaned and preprocessed to be ready for analysis. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format for Power BI.

## Visualizations and Dashboards

Using Microsoft Power BI, I create a variety of visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and more. Each project includes:

- KPI generation
- Interactive visualizations
- Comprehensive dashboards that provide actionable insights

## Getting Started

To explore these projects, you can download the Power BI Desktop application from the official Microsoft website. Open the `.pbix` files in the respective project folders using Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the visualizations and dashboards.
